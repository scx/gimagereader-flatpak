## FAQ

### Known issues

`gimagereader-gtk`:
 * Unable to hide the `Manage Languages` position from menu when using `System-wide paths` and using **PackageKit** doesn't make much sense in the sandboxed environment.
 * Unable to manage languages when using `User paths`: `Failed to fetch list of available languages: Failed to fetch list of available languages: ` (`gio.File.read_finish`: `Operation not supported` - probably missing required dependencies for **GVFS**, maybe the `http` backend?).
 * Unable to download dictionaries when using `User paths`: `Could note read https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/: .` (`gio.File.read_finish`: `Operation not supported` - probably missing required dependencies for **GVFS**, maybe the `http` backend?).
